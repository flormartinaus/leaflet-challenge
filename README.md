 This project aims to provide a visual representation of earthquake data collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using interactive maps. The goal is to develop a user-friendly tool that effectively communicates the magnitude, location, and depth of earthquakes to the public and government organizations.

## Background
The USGS is responsible for collecting and analyzing data related to natural hazards, environmental health, and climate change. With a massive amount of earthquake data collected daily from various locations worldwide, the USGS requires a comprehensive visualization solution to present this information in a meaningful way.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a set of tools that will allow the USGS to visualize their earthquake data effectively. By creating interactive maps, the project aims to educate the public and government organizations about the challenges our planet faces due to seismic activities. Additionally, the project aims to assist the USGS in securing funding for their ongoing research and data collection efforts.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were utilized in this project:

Leaflet: A JavaScript library for interactive maps.
HTML: The standard markup language for creating web pages.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets for styling the web pages.
JavaScript: The programming language used for implementing interactive functionalities.
D3: A JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.

## Resources
The project utilized various resources for development, including:

Class exercises: Incorporating concepts and techniques learned during the course.
Stack Overflow: Community-driven question and answer platform for troubleshooting.
ASK BCS: Consultation and guidance from BCS tutors.
Tutorials: Online tutorials and documentation for learning and implementing specific features.
YouTube tutorials: Video tutorials for understanding and applying relevant techniques.
Leaflet plug-ins: Additional plug-ins for extending the functionality of the Leaflet library.
Usage
To visualize the earthquake data, follow these steps:

Access the project repository: GitHub Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in a web browser.
The interactive map will display the earthquake data, showcasing the magnitude, location, and depth of each earthquake.
Click on a marker to view additional details about each earthquake.
